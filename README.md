## Project Notebooks

1. **Mine Prediction using Sonar Data**:
   - Notebook: `mine-prediction/mine_prediction_using_sonar_data.ipynb`
   - Description: Predicting whether an underwater object is a mine or a rock based on sonar data.
   - Techniques: Classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).

2. **Breast Cancer Prediction**:
   - Notebook: `breast-cancer/breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb`
   - Description: Detecting malignant or benign breast tumors using features from fine-needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies.
   - Techniques: Support Vector Machines (SVM), logistic regression, feature selection.
